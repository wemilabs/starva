## Key Workflows

### Order Lifecycle
1. **Pending** - Order placed by customer
2. **Confirmed** - Business confirms the order
3. **Preparing** - Order is being prepared
4. **Ready** - Order ready for pickup/delivery
5. **Delivered** - Order completed
6. **Cancelled** - Order cancelled (by customer or business)

### Multi-tenant Architecture
Each organization operates independently with:
- Separate product catalogs
- Independent order management
- Team member management with roles (owner, admin, member)
- Organization-scoped analytics

## Development

```bash
# Run development server
pnpm dev

# Run linting
pnpm lint

# Run database migrations
pnpm db-push
```
